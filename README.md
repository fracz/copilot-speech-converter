# CoPilot speech (voice) files converter (.ogg files <-> .inx and .dat files)


It was really simple before CoPilot 8.2 - all voices were just sets of .ogg sound files and if you wanted to change some of them - you just replaced sound files with desired ones.

Since CoPilot 8.2, all voices are packed into `.dat` and `.inx` files. With this simple project you can convert your voices from one method to another.

If you want to change only few sounds in your speech (most cases):

 * Upload you original .inx and .dat files with the first form
 * Download generated archive
 * Edit or replace desired sounds in the archive
 * Upload the archive using the second form
 * Download archive with new .inx and .dat files
 * Replace them with your current .inx and .dat files on your phone
 * Enjoy!

Do not change sound filenames in the archive and always remember to backup you original speech data!
